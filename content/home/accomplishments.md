  description: "Recent studies report that the overall burden of tariffs has entirely passed to U.S. firms and consumers in terms of higher import prices. However, using 10-digits import data from U.S. Customs for 2018-2019, we find that import prices of steel products behaved differently: First, foreign exporters have gradually decreased their prices, sharing almost 50 percent of the burden of increased tariffs for all steel products mostly determined by industrial supplies and materials. Second, the price and import elasticities for consumer steel products are substantially higher at 5 and - 8, respectively. Third, the immediate increase in prices of industrial supplies was near 100 percent, which decreased to slightly below 50 percent in the long run. The elasticity of imports increased over time to near 1 in the long run. The imports of steel products, which have moved in tandem with domestic steel consumption over the last ten years, exhibited a diverging trend after the imposition of tariffs. The steel imports had declined from 34.5 in 2017 to 26.3 million metric tons in 2019. During the same period, domestic production increased from 81.6 to 87.9 million metric tons, almost equal to the peak production the U.S. achieved in 2012 and 2014."

  description: "Do Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) increase the dollar value of already exported products–the intensive export margins? Recent literature has documented an ambiguous impact on exports of these products. I develop a framework that explains the source of ambiguous effects of FTAs on intensive export margins. I use 6-digit bilateral trade data and five FTAs to estimate the dynamic effects of the agreements on Canadian exports to its FTA partners. I first divide the pre-agreement export basket into two groups, i.e., products at positive and negative intensive margins. My difference-in-differences estimates show that (i) export value of both groups of products increases significantly in the short- and long-term for developed FTA partners. (ii) In cases where FTA partners are emerging markets, the impact is insignificant or negative in both the short- and long-term. Regression Discontinuity Design estimates also suggest that the impact of FTA on the export value of products at intensive margins depends on whether the FTA partners are emerging or developed markets."

  description: "We estimate returns to scale at the industry level using the longest consistent dataset
available for the U.S. economy. Focussing on the data since the late 1980s, the average estimate is 1, implying constant returns. An intuitive identity linking returns to scale, the markup, and the profit rate, gives small implied average gross and value-added markups of approximately 5 and 10 percent, respectively, given our measure of the profit rate, over the past 30 years. This gross markup estimate is significantly less than the average gross markup estimates in the recent literature ranging from 30 – 40 percent during this period. Put differently, given our estimated profit rate, large markups imply strongly increasing returns, which are not evident in the aggregate data."
