Born and raised in Okara, Pakistan, I am a Doctor of Philosophy in Economics with a focus on Monetary Economics and Econometrics. I was educated at Government College Lahore (GCU), Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), Memorial University of Newfoundland (MUN), and Carleton University.

I began my teaching career as an Economics teacher in Pakistan. After several years working in the related fields, such as undergraduate and graduate teaching in Economics, Quantitative Methods, and Econometrics, I proceeded into doctoral-level studies in Economics at Carleton University.

I do empirical work in Macroeconomics and International Trade. I am currently working as a Lecturer/Contract Instructor in Economics Department at and Carleton University respectively.
